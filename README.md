## Technologies Used
- **Redux Toolkit**: Chosen for its efficiency in managing the application's state, Redux Toolkit offers a set of tools that streamline state-related operations. It simplifies the process of setting up the Redux store, writing reducers, and performing asynchronous tasks, which is crucial for maintaining the responsiveness and interactivity of BudgetBeacon.

- **Styled-Components**: This technology is pivotal for crafting a consistent and engaging user interface. Styled-components allow for the creation of reusable, modular style snippets in JavaScript, which enhances the maintainability of the codebase. By encapsulating styles at the component level, we ensure a cohesive look and feel across the application while promoting ease of changes and updates.

## Reflection and Learning
The development of BudgetBeacon has been a journey of understanding user needs and translating them into a functional tool. It has taught us the importance of simplicity in design and the value of clear financial insights.
